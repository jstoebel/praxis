      Dear {stu_first},
      <p>Your recent Praxis scores came back and unfortunately it looks like you did not pass the following tests:<br>
      <ol>
	  
<!--Here is where the tests go-->
	  {tests}

<!--This is the final part of the email to the student.-->

</ol>
        If you would like to take the test again, please make an appointment with me to discuss your next steps. Also, the department may pay the fee for your retest. If you are interested you will need to write a letter to the department chair, Dr. Carter at <a href="mailto:cartery@berea.edu"> cartery@berea.edu </a>. Let her know why you believe you did not pass and how you plan to bring your score up. Successful letters will include a thoughtful, specific study plan to achieve a passing score. If you need help developing a study plan or writing this letter, contact your advisor. Let me know if you have any questions. All decisions on funding are based on the chair's discretion and availability of funds.
		<p>
		Best,<br>
